        <h1 style="text-align: center;">ARPANET and the Beginning of the Internet</h1>
        <p>You most likely use the Internet everyday and not think twice about it.
            Or you may think that the Internet is something magical that people smarter than yourself 
            thought up in a dream. Whatever you think about the Internet
            (unless you already read the contents of this webpage) is probably not the whole picture. The people who made 
            the Internet are most likely smarter than you and us, but that does not stop you from learning 
            <a href="rileyPage.html">the fundamental technology that spurred its development</a>, 
            <a href= "stepsOfTheArpanet.html">the ARPANET</a>, and <a href= "mattPage.html">how the Internet was born from the ARPANET</a>. Our main goal in these articles is to find what early influences shaped the system
            that allows you to read this page. In this spirit, we decided to keep the website barebones, like the good ol' days.
