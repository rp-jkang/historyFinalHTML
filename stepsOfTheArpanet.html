    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Creation of the ARPANET</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">By Riley Palomata</h3>
    <p>
        The steps to start the ARPANET may have been started with Paul Baran and his ideas of
        packet switching but the person to imagine the ARPANET was J. C. R. Lickider in a research
        paper which described a "Galatic Network" of interconnected computers<sub><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sub>.
        Lickider worked for the government agency ARPA (hence the name ARPANET) and evetually became the first director
        of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). Another individual who joined the ARPA team to
        work on the ARPANET was Robert Taylor. He joined ARPA in 1965 and in 1966 he became the director
        of IPTO. During his time working at ARPA he saw thateach mainframe or computer that IPTO was funding 
        "had its own sense of community and was digitallyisolated from the other one<sub><a href="#footnote2">2</a> </sub>." 
        As director he saw that "if ARPA's scattered computers could be linkedtogether, hardware, software, and 
        data could be efficiently pooled among contractors rather than wastefully 
        duplicated<sub><a href="#footnote2">2</a> </sub>."

        <sub><a href="#footnote3">3.</a> Map of ARPA research centers to be connected.</sub>
    </div>
    <p>
        The director who actually oversaw the completion of the ARPANET was Lawrence Roberts a researcher from MIT 
        who was strong armed with the threat of funding cuts from ARPA to join the 
        project<sub><a href="#footnote4">3.</a></sub>. Roberts was the one to decide that the network would 
        be a distributed packet switching system like the one Paul Baran imagined for his communication network.
