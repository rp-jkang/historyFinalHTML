    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Creation of the ARPANET</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">By Riley Palomata</h3>
    <p>
        The steps to start the ARPANET may have been started with Paul Baran and his ideas of
        packet switching but the person to imagine the ARPANET was J. C. R. Licklider in a research
        paper which described a "Galatic Network" of interconnected computers<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>.
        Licklider worked for the government agency ARPA (hence the name ARPANET) and eventually became the first director
        of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). Another individual who joined the ARPA team to
        work on the ARPANET was Robert Taylor. He joined ARPA in 1965 and in 1966 he became the director
        of IPTO. During his time working at ARPA he saw that each mainframe or computer that IPTO was funding
        "had its own sense of community and was digitally isolated from the other one<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a>
        </sup>."
        As director he saw that "if ARPA's scattered computers could be linked together, hardware, software, and
        data could be efficiently pooled among contractors rather than wastefully
        duplicated<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a> </sup>."
    </p>

        <sup><a href="#footnote3">3.</a> Map of ARPA research centers to be connected.</sup>
    </div>
    <p>
        The director who actually oversaw the completion of the ARPANET was Lawrence Roberts a researcher from MIT
        who was strong armed with the threat of funding cuts from ARPA to join the
        project<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>. Roberts was the one to decide that the network would
        be a distributed packet switching system like the one Paul Baran imagined for his communication network.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Major Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        When packet switching was introduced to this project it was very controversial because communication specialists
        who worked on telephone lines knew how difficult it would be to do packet switching in this large of a system.
        The experts thought that implementing packet switching would add too much to the complexity of the system.
        Another
        problem that arose was that the computers that were being connected were all different. This is challenging
        because
        each computer would have each had a different internal protocol in how they stored their data locally
        <sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>. In speaking with researchers at Cambridge he realized there needed to be
        a standard protocol  for messages to be sent over the network to overcome the incompatibilities between different
        computers.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Building the Network</h2>
    <p>
        The main challenge with the was getting the incompatibilities between the computers compatible. In addition
        to adding protocols to the messages sent over the network Roberts decided there needed to be a interface
        message processor (IMP) or minicomputer which handled the packets and was the interface between
        the mainframe and the network <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>. The IMP first had to break up the
        messages into smaller parts and add a source and destination header. When the IMP on the other
        end needed to strip the packet headers off and reassemble the packets before giving it to the
        host computer. The IMPs that were transmitting the messages between endpoints sent the message
        to the next IMP in and waits for a response that the packet was received. If the response is not
        sent then a new packet is sent. Each IMP kept a table for each host on the network that held the information
        of other IMPs and message travel time between them so that the IMP could determine the fastest route.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"></h2style> Public Test</h3>
    <p>
    The first major public demonstration of the ARPANET took place
    at the International Conference on Computer Communications in 1972. During this event, researchers
    showcased the network's ability to link distant computers together in real time.
    The demonstration involved connecting from Washington, D.C., to a computer at MIT,
    which then remotely executed a program running at UCLA. The results were transmitted back to
    Washington to be printed, proving that a nationwide network of shared computer resources was not
    only possible but already functioning. This demonstration is widely credited with convincing the
    broader scientific and engineering communities of the ARPANET's potential
