    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Creation of the ARPANET</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">By Riley Palomata</h3>
    <p>
        The steps to start the ARPANET may have been started with Paul Baran and his ideas of
        packet switching but the person to imagine the ARPANET was J. C. R. Lickider in a research
        paper which described a "Galatic Network" of interconnected computers<sub><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sub>.
        Lickider worked for the government agency ARPA (hence the name ARPANET) and the government's 
        goal with the project was for the nuclear war scare. Another individual who joined the ARPA team to
         work on the ARPANET was Robert Taylor. He joined ARPA in 1965 and in 1966 he became the director
         of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). During his time working at ARPA he saw that 
         each mainframe or computer that IPTO was funding "had its own sense of community and was digitally
        isolated from the other one<sub><a href="#footnote2">2</a> </sub>." As director he saw that "if ARPA's scattered computers could be linked
        together, hardware, software, and data could be efficiently pooled among contractors rather than 
        wastefully duplicated<sub><a href="#footnote2">2</a> </sub>."
