    <h1>What is Packet Switching?</h1>
    <h3>By Riley Palomata</h3>
    <p>
        Packet switching is the main computing invention that allowed programmers to
        create the internet. Packet switching is simply the way some object or
        data is transferred between two endpoints <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
        . The main idea of packet switching in
        computing is to break up some amount of data into smaller parts or packets
        and send it across the network. Each individual packet does not travel across
        the same route between endpoints, rather each packet travels the best route
        to take to the endpoint which can change between packets. The packets travel through
        nodes and the current node decides which next node is best to send the packet to.

    </div>

    <p>
        A simpler idea of this that we many know is how the United States Postal System works.
        When you send a package through the mail or go into the post office that is like sending
        a packet to a node with a destination. At each post office that your package goes through,
        the office decides where next is best to send the package and it is not always the same.
        For instance, if there was a large storm near one post office and mail cannot get there
        your package goes to a different office. This repeats until the package reaches it destination
        or endpoint. The only real difference with the post office example and packet switching for
        computers is that the package you would send through the mail would be broken up and sent
        to different post offices around the country and at its destination would be reassembled to be
        the original.

    </p>
    <p class="subheading">What Caused Packet Switching?</p>
    <p>
        You may already know that the original internet was built for military purposes but have you
        ever thought of why the military would invest in such a endeavor. This original internet or
        ARPANET was thought up due to a fear of nuclear war during the Cold War. The idea
        was to have surviving communication networks across the United States in the event of a
        nuclear disaster <sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>. The reason why communication would
        be necessary in this scenario is to know where the president would want to aim our nuclear
        warheads. Without this communication network the only way the president could get his message
        out is through public radio stations or telephone lines. The problem with this communication style
        is that this infrastructure could be taken down or damaged easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        The person who originally invented packet switching was a researcher named Paul Baran who worked for
        the Rand Corporation<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>, the Air Forces' "think tank." Baran imagined
        a system where military personnel could carry some node that could receive and transmit data. This was the
        first instance of a distributed system, or a system that had many switching nodes and many links to each node,
        increasing redundancy <sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>.
    </p>

        <sup><a href="#footnote5">5.</a> Baran's System</sup>
    </div>
    <p>
        Baran's innovation in communication systems in the form of packet switching is what inevitably lead to the
        invention of the working version of the ARPANET. Even though Baran never formally worked on the protocols for
        the ARPANET he was an informal consultant for those working on the project.
